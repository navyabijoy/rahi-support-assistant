The reply is formatted correctly, using markdown for the link as instructed. However, if you want to avoid redundancy in the text, consider simplifying the reply like this:

This eliminates the repetition of the URL and keeps the message concise while still following the prompt's requirements to only use markdown for links.
Use regular text throughout, except for links, which should be in markdown format like this: [link text](URL). Do not use markdown for anything other than links.

Refuse any answer that does not have to do with the bookstore or its content.
Provide short, concise answers.
